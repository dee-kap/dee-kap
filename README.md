### Hi, I'm Deepak (he/him) ðŸ‘‹

- I am a Fullstack software developer from Sydney Australia.

* ðŸ”­ For most of my career, I have focused on Web development and APIs
* ðŸŒ± I have written code in many programming languages. These days I enjoy writing **TypeScript**, **Python** and **Ruby**
* ðŸ“š Beyond the code, I love reading and have a personal collection of around 800 books. These are my prized possessions.
* ðŸ’¬ I'm always open to a chat about technology, programming and books.
* âš¡ New Zealand is my favourite country. In New Zealand, there is a city called Auckland, in Auckland there is a suburb called Papatoetoe, in Papatoetoe there is a street called Deepak Lane. Of course it is not named after me, but that's what I tell people. Please keep this a secret.
